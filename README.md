## Object Oriented Design

You should have a working knowledge of a few common and useful design patterns (singleton, factory, adapter, bridge, visitor, command, proxy, observer, etc.) as well as know how to write software in an object oriented way with appropriate use of inheritance and aggregation.

## Cultural Survey

It would be good to review our 14 leadership principals, because the survey will focus around those. This portion of the assessment is equally as important as the technical component. Have a look at our 14 leadership principles (link below) and think about experiences in your career that pertain to each principle.

I would recommend preparing for the test, below are some good resources (not sponsored by Amazon):

www.Leetcode.com â€“ Take 3-5 practice questions in Easy/Medium Algorithm, Databases, and Object Oriented categories

https://www.amazon.jobs/principles - great for reviewing for the non-technical aspects of this assessment
